# Sentiment Analysis 377a

On 29 November 2022, the Singapore Parliament voted to repeal a law criminalising gay sex, known as Section 377A of the Penal Code in a historic move. The law, introduced under British colonial rule in 1938, had been in force for over 80 years. Its repeal was widely celebrated by activists and members of the LGBTQ+ community, who had been calling for its repeal since as early as 2007 in Singapore (Channel News Asia, 2022b). On the other hand, some conservative members of society, such as religious groups, have expressed disappointment. At the same time as the repeal, however, the Singapore Parliament also amended the Constitution to introduce a new Institution of Marriage clause in Singaporeâ€™s constitution, to the celebration of some and outrage of others.
